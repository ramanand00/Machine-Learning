# UNIT 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## 1. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning is a technique where machines learn patterns from data and improve their performance automatically with experience.

**Example:**  
- Gmail detecting spam emails  
- YouTube recommending videos  
- Face recognition on smartphones  

**Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning:**  
Traditional Programming: Rules + Data → Output
Machine Learning: Data + Output → Rules (Model)

## 2. Why Machine Learning is Important

Machine Learning is important because:  
- Computers can analyze huge amounts of data  
- Reduces human effort  
- Provides accurate predictions  
- Learns and improves over time  

**Key Benefits:**  
- Automation of tasks  
- Better decision-making  
- High efficiency  
- Works with complex data

## 3. Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

| Feature                    | Traditional Programming        | Machine Learning              |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Rules                       | Written by humans             | Learned from data             |
| System                      | Static                        | Dynamic and adaptive          |
| Improvement                 | Cannot improve automatically | Improves with experience      |
| Task suitability            | Simple tasks                  | Complex tasks                 |

**Example:**  
- Traditional: Calculator  
- Machine Learning: Recommendation system

## 5. Types of Machine Learning

### 5.1 Supervised Learning
- Model trained with labeled data (input + correct output)  
- **Example:** Predicting house price, Email spam detection  
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN  

### 5.2 Unsupervised Learning
- Data has no labels  
- Machine finds patterns on its own  
- **Example:** Customer grouping, Market segmentation  
- **Algorithms:** K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA  

### 5.3 Semi-Supervised Learning
- Combination of supervised and unsupervised learning  
- **Example:** Large amount of unlabeled data + small labeled data  
- Used when labeling data is expensive  

### 5.4 Reinforcement Learning
- Machine learns by trial and error  
- **Example:** Game playing AI, Robot navigation  
- **Key Terms:** Agent, Environment, Reward, Action

## 6. Machine Learning vs AI vs Deep Learning

| Feature        | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning       | Deep Learning         |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Definition     | Making machines intelligent | Learning from data    | Learning using neural networks |
| Dependency     | Independent concept   | Subset of AI           | Subset of ML         |
| Data Requirement | Low                  | Medium                | Very High            |
| Example        | Chatbot               | Spam filter            | Face recognition     |

**Relation:**  
AI ⊃ ML ⊃ Deep Learning
